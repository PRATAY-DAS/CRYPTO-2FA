# Crypto-Based Two-Factor Authentication System

## Overview

This project aims to create a highly secure, crypto-based two-factor authentication (2FA) system from scratch using Python. The system will feature both a frontend and backend, designed to be 'unhackable' and robust against various cyber threats.

## Features

- **High Security:** Utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure security.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Combines something you know (password) with something you have (authentication token).
- **Cross-Platform:** Designed for both Windows and Android.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and intuitive frontend for easy interaction.

## Getting Started
